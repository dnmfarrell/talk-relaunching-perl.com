## Future

---

### Objective: more pageviews

<!--

* Pageviews are a proxy for popularity
* Promote Perl
* Community growth

-->
---

To get more pageviews we need to:

1. Publish more popular articles
2. Publish more frequently
3. Keep visitors for longer

---

### More popular articles

* More beginner topics
* Mine adwords for popular search topics (for "bounties")

---

### Publish more frequently

* Ask for help more
* Better contributing docs
* Recognition & rewards
* Corporate sponsorship for article "bounties"

---

### Keep visitors for longer

* "You may also like ..."
* Archive page
